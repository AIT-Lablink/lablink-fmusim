# The Lablink FMU Simulator

This package provides Lablink clients that can import and execute Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs), i.e., co-simulation components compliant to the [Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)](https://fmi-standard.org/).
The clients in this package rely on functionality provided by the [FMI++ Library](http://fmipp.sourceforge.net).
For more information, please refer to the [online documentation](https://ait-lablink.readthedocs.io/projects/lablink-fmusim).
